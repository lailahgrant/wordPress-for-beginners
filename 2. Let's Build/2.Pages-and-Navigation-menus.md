## Intro to Pages

### Pages Vs Pposts
1. What is the difference between a **Page** and a **Post**?

| Pages                                                                | Posts                                |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| - A page on a website e.g. about us page, contact page               | - Post is part of a collection       |
| - A page is meant to be its own independent entity (can stand alone) | - A blog lists multiple posts        |
| - Navigation meny typically links to pages                           | - Time sensitive (newest to the top) |
| - Usually not time sensitive                                         |                                      |
| - Evergreen content (page is timeless)                               |


- Create pages on the [WordPress Website created with Local](http://wordpress-for-beginners.local/wp-admin/)

#### Create a Navigation Menu
- On the admin dashboard, go to;
  - Appearance
  - Menus
    - Add Menu name (for organisation) [won't be displayed to users]
- By 2025 - WordPress has improved so much. I can't find the above `Menu` area.
- in the editor, click `Block`
- Click on the Menu, add the page you want in the Menu navigation
- Choose the Header design (Optional)
